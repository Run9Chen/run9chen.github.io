<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m Runjiu Chen, an ScM student in Epidemiology (Genetic track) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My research sits at the intersection of genetic epidemiology, machine learning, and computational genomics, with a focus on building interpretable models for complex biological and clinical data.

I have worked on spatiotemporal modeling of brain transcriptomic heterogeneity in development and Alzheimer’s disease, including the design of a two-stage framework that integrates spatiotemporal weighting and multi-step decision-tree modeling. I also study single-cell dynamics, applying RNA velocity and multi-omics integration to reconstruct lineage trajectories and infer cell fate transitions. In parallel, I develop clinical risk prediction models (e.g., depression risk in type 2 diabetes) using a combination of structural equation modeling and machine learning.

Previously, I received a B.S. in Statistics from Hunan University and completed a statistics program at UC Berkeley. I’m broadly interested in principled methods that translate high-dimensional omics and neuro/clinical signals into actionable insights—especially when interpretability and robustness matter.
